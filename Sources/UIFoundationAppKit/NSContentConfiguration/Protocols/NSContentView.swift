/// The requirements for a content view that you create using a configuration.
///
/// This protocol provides a blueprint for a content view object that renders the content and styling that you define with its configuration. The content view’s configuration encapsulates all of the supported properties and behaviors for content view customization. Setting the content view’s configuration property applies the new configuration to the view, causing the view to render any updates to its appearance.

    ///
    /// The default implementation assumes the view is compatible with configuration types that match the type of the view’s existing configuration.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - configuration: The new configuration to test for compatibility.
    ///
    /// - Returns: `true` if the view supports this configuration being set to its configuration property and is capable of updating itself for the configuration; otherwise, `false`.
