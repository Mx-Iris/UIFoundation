/// A structure that encapsulates a state for a view.
///
/// A view configuration state encompasses the common states that affect the appearance of the view — states like enabled, selected, or emphasized. You can use it to update the appearance.
///
/// Typically, you don’t create a configuration state yourself. To obtain a configuration state either use the view's `configurationUpdateHandler` or override its `updateConfiguration(using:)` method in a subclass and use the state parameter. Outside of this method, you can get the configuration state by using its `configurationState` property.
