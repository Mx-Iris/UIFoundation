# UIFoundation

> **This framework is currently under development, and the stability of any API is not guaranteed!!!**

This framework is built on top of AppKit/UIKit and aims to provide basic and practical components.

- **UIFoundation**: Built based on Apple's public APIs.
- **UIFoundationAppleInternal**: Built based on Apple's private APIs. Using this framework carries the risk of app rejection but provides more functionality.
